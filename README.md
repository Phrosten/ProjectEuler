# My solutions for Project Euler

This repository contains my personal solutions for problems on Project Euler.
*Do not use the solutions to cheat.*

## Structure

The directory "Problems" contains all problems that I have solved. In the
folders you will find subdirectories for the programming languages.

Each solution directory consists of a dev.org file that contains the problem
description, solution code as well as the code result. This org file is to be
used with emacs.

## Programming Languages

Currently, I am focusing on *Python*.
